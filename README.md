# DnD-Dice-Roller
A quick and dirty script that rolls dice for DnD using a GUI, and then displays the result both visually and using Text-To-Speech (Just to make sure you don't cheat ;p).

Run the script to use (python roll.py)

Requires tk and gTTS to work propely. You can install them with [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

```
sudo pip install tk
sudo pip install gTTS
```

# To do:
* Make more visually appealing
* Rewrite using classes
